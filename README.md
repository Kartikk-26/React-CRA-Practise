## üìù Overview

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in learning **React** through a structured course, focusing on real-world projects and daily practice. 

It emphasizes mastering key concepts like props, hooks, state management, and more advanced topics like Redux and Context API, all while building modern web applications with **Create React App**.

## ‚ö° Create React App

**Create React App (CRA)** is the foundation of the projects in this repository. CRA provides a streamlined environment for React development, offering everything needed to build and deploy React applications with minimal configuration.

To learn more about CRA, visit [the official CRA documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm** : You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **React Developer Tools** : A must-have browser extension for React developers, enabling easier debugging and component inspection.

To verify your Node.js installation, run:

```bash
node --version
```

## üí¨ Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kartikk-26/React-CRA-Practise.git
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd React-CRA-Practise
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

You can now view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìö Course Topics Covered

### Basic Topics:

1. **Props and Prop Drilling** : Passing data between components efficiently.
2. **Hooks**: Including `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for state and lifecycle management.
3. **Forms in React** : Building controlled and uncontrolled forms.
4. **Mapping Components** : Rendering lists of items using the `map()` function.
5. **Conditional Rendering** : Displaying elements conditionally based on state.
6. **Node Package Manager (NPM)** : Managing project dependencies.

### Advanced Topics:

1. **React Router DOM** : Enabling client-side routing in React applications.
2. **Code Optimization Tips** : Best practices for improving performance.
3. **Redux** : Implementing global state management.
4. **Redux Toolkit** : Simplifying Redux development with concise syntax.
5. **Redux Persist** : Persisting state across sessions.
6. **Context API** : Sharing state without prop drilling.
7. **Best Folder Structure** : Organizing React projects for maintainability.
